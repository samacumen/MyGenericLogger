# MyGenericLogger
A generic logger i thought to create would be useful for any project using variadic assignments/macros. The idea is derived from CodeProject (https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/987850/Logging-in-Cplusplus), along with a lot of improvements and library being made more generic to extension.
